# Google-Dorking-Lab

# Overview

This repository contains my work and notes from the Google Dorking lab on TryHackMe.
The lab focuses on using Google Search Operators for ethical reconnaissance and open-source intelligence (OSINT) — techniques used to discover hidden or sensitive information that is unintentionally exposed online.
By mastering Google Dorking, I learned how attackers and ethical hackers alike can leverage advanced search syntax to find valuable data such as exposed files, credentials, and configurations, as well as how to mitigate such risks.

# Objectives

The main objectives of this lab were to:
Understand how Google search operators work.
Perform targeted searches to find specific types of files or information.
Identify publicly available sensitive data using search techniques.
Learn how to protect systems from being exposed to these searches.
Apply ethical OSINT practices during reconnaissance.

#  Key Learning Outcomes

After completing the Google Dorking lab, I gained practical knowledge of:
Common search operators such as site:, filetype:, inurl:, intitle:, and cache:.
Techniques to locate configuration files, login portals, or admin panels.
Understanding how Google indexes sensitive data.
Preventing exposure through robots.txt, proper permissions, and data handling.
The importance of responsible use of OSINT and ethical reconnaissance.

# Conclusion

The Google Dorking lab provided a strong foundation in OSINT-based reconnaissance and information discovery.
It demonstrated how simple search techniques can uncover valuable insights — both as a defensive tool for securing systems and as an offensive tool for ethical hacking assessments.
Completing this lab enhanced my practical understanding of information exposure, data privacy, and ethical intelligence gathering in the cybersecurity field.
